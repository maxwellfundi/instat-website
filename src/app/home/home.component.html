      <h1>Teaching Resources for Community Based Learning</h1>
      <p>
        We are supporting teachers in the Community Based Learning programme by
        producing four daily session guides in a ready-to-use format. Sessions
        will be published on a daily basis making it easy for teachers to access
        and we also provide access to
        <a href="/all-sessions">all the daily sessions</a> so that teachers
        can start from the first set of materials or continue from the four new
        sessions published every weekday.
      </p>
      <h1>Today's Sessions</h1>
      <p>
        If you would like to prepare in advance, you can find tomorrow's
        sessions you can find them <a href="/next">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h1>Feedback</h1>
      <p>
        If you use our materials, we would be thankful if you could spend a few
        moments answering the following two feedback questions as often as you
        feel is useful.
