On the back of this, he became the main character on the campaign video that was used to crowd-source for funds. For almost two years since the start of ADI work, he has been coordinating and managing the software development team based in Kenya.
                      His role also includes running logistical aspects of the initiative while also being part of a team that manages the project funds. Recently, he was the first person to use the beta-version of the new software for teaching an undergraduate statistics course at Maseno University where he currently works as a lecturer. In the future he sees himself playing a major role in supporting fellow lecturers and educators in using the software to improve the teaching of statistics. </p>
